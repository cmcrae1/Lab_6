The first thing I did was to download the data for France and load it into GEODA.
Then I opened the weights manager and created the Guerry_85_q category. I then
created a natural breaks map of donations per capita. Then I performed a univariate
local Moran's 1 and set the variable name as Donatns. This created two maps, one
significance map and one cluster map. I then used the randomization tool to
increase the number of permutations. Next I analyzed the outliers using the scatter
plot to select which values I would like to look at. Next I added the three categories
LISA_I, LISA_CL, and LISA_P. After that I added a significance filter of .01, which
took out non significant data. Next I explored the Boneferroni bound procedure. After
that I added the I and FDR tables to the attribute table. Next I looked at the cores
and neighbors while widening the P values. The conditional map came next and I
compared literacy to clergy. After this I created univariate local geary cluster map.
For the last part I choose to compare percent males vs. clergy and the results showed
that there wasnt much correlation between the 2. In fact there was a negative
correlation between the two.
